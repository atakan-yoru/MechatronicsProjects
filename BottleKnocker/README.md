# Bottle Knocker
![](https://github.com/prof-nimbus/MechatronicsProjects/blob/main/BottleKnocker/BottleKnocker.gif?raw=true)
In this project, it is asked to come up with a robotic design that knocks down empty water bottles, which are numbered counter-clockwise and arranged in a semi-circle with non-arbitrary or arbitrary placements, in a specific order given by the instructor. For more detail on the tasks required to be accomplished by the design, it is suggested to read the project document pdf.
## Approach
The proposed design is to have a concentric system that has a moving arm equipped with an infrared sensor for readings, moving just around the circumference of the semi-circle that utilizes a simple RC motor. In the lack of angle control, a hit-or-skip algorithm is used to account for both non-arbitrary and arbitrary placements with different sequences. Simply, the algorithm is built around the idea of counter-clockwise and fixed starting point initiation together with the triggering count of the system. Knowing the sequencing, the system would know how many times it has to skip before reaching the correct one by storing the triggering count of the sensor. Following this the system decides whether to rotate counter-clockwise or clockwise to reach the next bottle in the sequence in the shortest path possible and repeat the same procedure until all the bottles are knocked down.
